There are four links there, two of them are deprecated, which are:

- ICEWS Event Aggregations
    - Which want to aggregate the events into a monthly basis
- ICEWS Events of Interest Ground Truth Data Set
    - Rather than from the temporal aspect to aggregate the events
    - this is used to aggregate the events from a semantic
      aspect
    - With the latest advanced in LLM, I will say this can be done via semantic retrieval
    - ![event_of_interest](../imgs/event-of-interest.png)

Both of them were deprecated in 2015.

ICEWS Dictionaries are kind of ontology of the datasets, which is still useful.
The core event data is the ICEWS Events data, which is from this
