**How human handle the temporal information and answer the temporal questions?**

## Information Indexing

When we see something, for example, an accident happen near our home in today morning.
We need to first index this event into our brain.
As we live in a three dimension space together with a time dimension,
when we want to store this in our memory, (we will treat our memory as a N dimension space)

1. Index the spatial dimensions: is this close to my home or close to one of the point of interest in my mind
2. Index the temporal dimension: Temporal have several aspects
    - Treat temporal as **Straight Homogenous(Objective)** Timeline:
        - Exact date when it happen, for example, [2023-05-01 10:00:00, 2023-05-01 10:30:00]
    - Treat temporal as **Cycle Homogenous(Objective)** Timeline:
        - Monday, First day of Month, Spring, 21st Century, etc.
        - (You can aslo cycle the timeline based on your own requirement)
    - Treat temporal as **Straight Hoterogenous(Subjective)** Timeline:
        - If you sleep during night, it will be fast for you in the 8 hours, however, if someone is working overnight,
          time will be slow for him.
    - Treat temporal as **Cycle Hoterogenous(Subjective)** Timeline:
        - Life has different turning points for everyone, until they reach the end of their life.
3. Then index the information part: What happen, who is involved, what is the impact, etc.

So in summary, we can say that in our mind, if we treat the event as embedding in our human mind:

- part of the embedding will represent the temporal dimension information,
- part of the embedding will represent the spatial dimension information,
- the rest of the embedding will represent the general information part.

This will help us to retrieve the information when we need it.
