# Objective Event Timeline

## How human handle temporal information?

### Information Indexing

When we see something, for example, an accident happen near our home in today morning.
We need to first index this event into our brain.
As we live in a three dimension space together with a time dimension,
when we want to store this in our memory, (we will treat our memory as a N dimension space).

1. Index the spatial dimensions:
    - Is this close to my home or close to one of the point of interest in my mind
2. Index several temporal dimension:
    - Treat temporal as **Straight Homogenous(*Objective*)** Timeline:
        - Exact date when it happen, for example, [2023-05-01 10:00:00, 2023-05-01 10:30:00]
    - Treat temporal as **Cycle Homogenous(*Objective*)** Timeline:
        - Monday, First day of Month, Spring, 21st Century, etc.
        - (You can aslo cycle the timeline based on your own requirement)
    - Treat temporal as **Straight Hoterogenous(*Subjective*)** Timeline:
        - If you sleep during night, it will be fast for you in the 8 hours, however, if someone is working overnight,
          time will be slow for him.
    - Treat temporal as **Cycle Hoterogenous(*Subjective*)** Timeline:
        - Life has different turning points or milestones for each individual, until they reach the end of their life.
3. Then index the information part:
    - What happen
    - Who is involved
    - What is the impact
    - etc.

We are handling the first type of Timeline in this document.

Which is:

**Straight Homogenous(*Objective*)** Timeline
